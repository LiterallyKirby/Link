This blog's basically just a dumping ground for whatever I'm building, breaking, or over-engineering at 3 AM.\n\nExpect a mix of code snippets, screenshots, and the occasional rant about why some library refuses to compile. I might also drop thoughts on design or random tech stuff if I feel like it.\n\nAnyway, if you somehow found this — hi. You're early. There's nothing here yet.",
